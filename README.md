# Weather JS App

A plain vanilla javascript (HTML, CSS, JS) weather app that shows current weather, 7 days forecast and hourly forecast. 

Based on [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0VEOghdMpQ), but with the following improvements
- Use Google Fonts and Font Awesome instead of local svg images
- Use Tailwind CSS instead of plain CSS
- Responsive Layout
- Load city name from coordinates
- Support name search for local city weather
